# Typology of Elements

**Papanasi** has four different types of elements, that ones are: `layout`, `components`, `enterprise` and `extensions`. Each type has a **different purpose** and a different way of being used, explained in the next lines.

## Layout

Those elements are made to **help the developer to create a basic layout** for any page, that kind of elements exist in all the UI Libraries that you can imagine, and they are the ones that you will use the most.

What makes these from Papanasi different is that they are **fully customizable**. You can use them as they are, or you can customize them to fit your needs.

Some examples are `Container`, `Row` and `Column`.

<Canvas>
  <Container>
    <Row>
      <Column>Row 1 - Column 1 of 3</Column>
      <Column>Row 1 - Column 2 of 3</Column>
      <Column>Row 1 - Column 3 of 3</Column>
    </Row>
    <Row>
      <Column>Row 2 - Column 1 of 3</Column>
      <Column>Row 2 - Column 2 of 3</Column>
      <Column>Row 2 - Column 3 of 3</Column>
    </Row>
    <Row>
      <Column>Row 3 - Column 1 of 3</Column>
      <Column>Row 3 - Column 2 of 3</Column>
      <Column>Row 3 - Column 3 of 3</Column>
    </Row>
  </Container>
</Canvas>

## Components

Are the core of **Papanasi**, all the components should follow the [manifesto](https://github.com/CKGrafico/papanasi#-manifesto), should be also **customizable from global or scoped variables**.

Most popular components are `Button` or `Avatar`:

<Canvas>
  <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
  <Button variant="tertiary" outline>
    Tertiary
  </Button>
  <Avatar name="Alis Mug" />
</Canvas>

## Enterprise

Those elements are the ones that are **specific for a company or library**, and they are not part of the core of **Papanasi**. The main idea is to bring the opportunity to create components from **SDKs** or **APIs** writing the code just once.

The first enterprise component was `Itchio`:

<Canvas>
  <Itchio user="ckgrafico" game="alice-ring" width={800} height={600}>
    <span>Click me</span>
  </Itchio>
</Canvas>

## Extensions

Papanasi extensions are **plugins** that can be used to extend our functionality. Those are not components are can be used as any other library.

A good example of an extension is the `Tooltip`:

<Canvas>
  {(() => {
    useTooltipExtension(document.body.querySelector('.tooltip-example'));
    return '';
  })()}
  <div className="tooltip-example">
    <span title="Example tooltip" style={{ fontSize: '3rem' }}>
      Hover me
    </span>
  </div>
</Canvas>

<Customization hidden={true} />
