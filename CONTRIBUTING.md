### Creating components
Right now we have three kind of components that kind inspire you to add new components to this project (or create one that is in the issues).
- **Regular component**: The best example is the [Button](https://papanasi.js.org/?path=/docs/components-button--default-story) component, a regular component is a component that has all the logic managed by itslef and has no dependencies, some examples in any library can be a `button`, `pill`, `switch`, `loading`, etc.
- **Wrapper component**: A good example can be the [Code](https://papanasi.js.org/?path=/docs/components-code--default-story) component, this kind of components are wrapping vanilla JavaScript libraries and converting them to universal components, like `select`, `table`, `virtual-scroll`, etc.
- **Layout component**: There are not a lot like this, but [Column](https://papanasi.js.org/?path=/docs/layout-column--default-story) component, is the example that can represent them better, are useful to improve the layout.
