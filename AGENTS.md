# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Dependency Management: Yarn v1 Required

This project uses **Yarn v1 (Classic)** for all dependency management and scripts.

- Do not use npm or Yarn v2+ (Berry) for installing dependencies or running scripts.
- If you do not have Yarn v1 installed, run:

```bash
npm install -g yarn@1.22.19
```

- Always use `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- Do not delete or regenerate `yarn.lock` with a different Yarn version.

Check your Yarn version with:

```bash
yarn --version
```
It should print a version like `1.22.x`.
